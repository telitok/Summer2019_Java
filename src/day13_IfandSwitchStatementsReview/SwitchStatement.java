	   case is similar with else-if
	   
	   default section is similar with else statement.
	   default section will get executed when there is no cases that matches with the given expression.
	   
	   default section can be placed anywhere with in switch statement.
	   
	   > In switch statement none of the blocks ( cases and default) or statements (break)are mandatory.
